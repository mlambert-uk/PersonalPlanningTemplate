Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes. Carl Jung

The power of a vision statement lies in imagining a better future for yourself. Right now things may be difficult or unsatisfying. So envision a more fulfilling life. One that makes use of your passion and interests. That lets you be more authentic in everything you do. What might that look like?

## **Sample Personal Vision Statement**

There will always be constraints in your life. Money, health, the economy, long held fears. Try to put these aside and tap into your intuition for a moment. Then project out a five to ten year timeframe. You might come up with a vision statement along the following lines:

“I am more courageous in my day to day living. There is extra time for family and loved ones, healthy activities, and good old-fashioned fun. I don’t hide my values or pretend to be something I’m not. My basic financial needs are met and I’ve saved just enough to pay for a career change.”
