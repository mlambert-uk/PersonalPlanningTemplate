A mission statement is not something you write overnight... But fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your vision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life.” That’s according to Stephen Covey, author of The Seven Habits Of Highly Successful People.

A personal mission underpins your career mission statement, yet the two differ. Your career version strategically plans where you want to be professionally in five years. The personal type deals with how you define your purpose as an individual.
## Personal Mission Statement Example
Whether your mission is lofty or more down to earth depends entirely on you. Here is a sample:

“To be a decent person who is respected by family, friends, loved ones and my chosen communities. I am here to make a positive difference despite being imperfect. My work reflects my values and enables me to travel widely and enhance the lives of others. People will remember me for being there to lend a hand, keeping an open mind, and for getting involved in issues that matter most to me.”

Your version could be much more specific. Notice that there is legacy involved; capturing the impression you want people to summon when they think about you. Consider using a day off for career development when pondering this.
