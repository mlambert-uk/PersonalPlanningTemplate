As you seek to understand our [[5 - Resources/Sources/Personal Planning Template Documentation/Personal Brand|Personal Brand]] we need to establish what our values are.  These are where our morals and decisions come from.

Be consistent with – and supportive of – your mission and vision. The resulting personal values statement may resemble this example:

>[!quote]
“To try and be honest (yet not deliberately hurtful) when dealing with people. But I will also strive to be more assertive, politely when possible, so I don’t get trampled on. Money is important. I have to earn enough to afford the things I really like. Visiting different places around the world with my romantic partner important to me. So is being in the outdoors and enjoying nature.”
