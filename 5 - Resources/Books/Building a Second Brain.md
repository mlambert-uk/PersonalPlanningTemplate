# Notes
## Part One
### The Foundation - Understanding what's possible
#### Where It All Started
We are constantly bombarded by information.  From websites, emails, social media.  All vying for our attention.  Keeping track of what is important and staying productive can be challenging.  By taking notes of the important information and storing it in a searchable, linkable repository, we remove the burden from our brains and put it into a separate, safe store, where it can be accessed and found as required.

Instead of empowering us, this deluge of information often overwhelms us.  Information overload has become Information Exhaustion, leaving us constantly anxious that we.re forgetting something.

We cannot use our head to store everything we need to know!  We need to outsource the job of remembering information to machines.  
#### What is a Second Brain?
##### Commonplace books
For centuries, artists and intellectuals have recorded ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them called a "commonplace book".
They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them into different sections within their own notebooks.
##### The ***Digital*** Commonplace Book
Once our ideas become digital, they can be searched, organised and synced across all our devices, and backed up to the cloud for safe keeping.  We can cultivate our very own "Knowledge Vault" so we always know exactly where to look.
This Digital Commonplace book is what I call a **Second Brain**.  Think of it as a combination of a study book, personal journal and a sketchbook for new ideas.
##### Rethinking Notetaking: Notes as Knowledge Building Blocks
In the professional world:
- It's not at all clear what you should be taking notes on
- No one tells you when or how your notes will be used
- You are allowed to reference your notes at any time
- You are expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them
#### How a Second Brain Works
Think of your Second Brain as the worlds best personal assistant.
##### The Superpowers of a Second Brain
There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us:
1. Making our ideas concrete
2. Revealing new associations between ideas
3. Incubating our ideas over time
4. Sharpening our unique perspectives
##### Choosing a Notetaking App:  The Neural Centre of your Second Brain
There are lots of applications to chose from, each with their pro's and con's.  Find one that works for you.  Ideally it should have these four powerful characteristics:
1. ***Multimedia*** - Just like a paper notebook, it should allow for drawings, sketches, photos, quotes as well as ideas so everything is contained in one place
2. ***Informal*** - Notes are inherently messy, so no need for perfect spelling, or polished presentation.  This makes it easy to jot things down as soon as they occur to you.
3. ***Open-ended*** - Taking notes is a continuous process.  Free-form exploration before you have a goal in mind.
4. ***Action-oriented*** - They should aim to help you remain focused on the task at hand.
For more information of the various options, check out this link [Second Brain Resource Guide](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources)
***Don't get trapped looking for the perfect system*** It's about having a *reliable* set of tools you can depend on.  You can always change them later if you find something better!
##### Remembering, Connecting, Creating: The Three Stages of Personal Knowledge Management
The first way we tend to use our Second Brain is as a memory aid.  Saving facts and ideas they would have trouble recalling.  Takeaways from meetings for example.
The second way is to connect ideas together.  Their Second Brain evolves from being a *memory* tool to becoming a *thinking* tool.
The third way is for creating new things.  They realise they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and sharable.
## Part Two
### The Method - The four Steps of Code
#### ***Capture*** - Keep what Resonates
##### Build a Private Collection of Knowledge
External knowledge could include:
- ***Highlights*** - Insightful passages from books or articles
- ***Quotes*** - Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks
- ***Bookmarks & favourites*** - Links to interesting content
- ***Voice memos*** - Clips recorded on your mobile as "notes to self"
- ***Meeting notes*** - Notes about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls
- ***Images*** - Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting
- ***Takeaways*** - Lessons from courses, conferences or presentations
Internal knowledge could include:
- ***Stories*** - Your favourite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else
- ***Insights*** - The small (and large) realisations you have
- ***Memories*** - Experiences from your life that you don't want to forget
- ***Reflections*** - Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary
- ***Musings*** - Random ideas that pop into your head
##### What ***Not*** to Keep
There are four kinds of content that aren't well suited to note apps:
- ***Sensitive information*** - Important sensitive information shouldn't be stored in a note app where the information is freely shared across multiple devices
- ***Special format or file type*** - Just link to the file but have it open in the correct app, or take a photo of what you need for your notes.
- ***Large files*** - Note apps are supposed to be short, lightweight bits of text and images.  Their performance will suffer if the files stored in them are too large
- ***Needs collaboration*** - Notes are perfect for individual and private use.  For collaboration, there are other, more suitable tools you can use
##### Capture Criteria
1. Does it Inspire me?
2. Is it useful?
3. Is it Personal
4. Is it Surprising?
>[!important]
>Ultimately, capture what resonates
#### ***Organise*** - Save for Actionability
Capturing notes without an effective way to organise and retrieve them can lead to you feeling overwhelmed

How to organise your notes in a meaningful way that allows you to maximise your productivity and focus on what is important to you right now.
- ***Projects*** - Short-term efforts in your work or life that you are working on now
- ***Areas*** - Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time
- ***Resources*** - Topics or interests that may be useful in the future
- ***Archives*** - Inactive items from the other three categories
##### ***Project*** - What I am working on right now
Projects have a couple of features:
1. They have a beginning and an end; they take place in a period of time, then they finish.
2. They have a specific, clear outcome.

Project examples could include:
- ***Projects at work***: Complete end of year reviews; Plan a talk
- ***Personal projects***: Finish planning for a holiday;  Plan to redecorate a room
- ***Side projects***: Add a new game to my website;  Complete a blog post
##### ***Area*** - What I am committed to over time
Areas have a few things that differentiate them from projects:
1. They do not have a timeframe
2. They could be responsibilities that we own

Area examples from your personal life could include:
- ***Activities or places you are responsible for*** - Home, cooking, travel, car etc.
- ***People you are responsible for or accountable to*** - Friends, kids, spouse, pets etc.
- ***Other groupings or responsibility*** - Personal health, finances etc.

Area examples from your work life could include:
- ***Departments or functions you are responsible for*** - Account management, product development etc.
- ***People or teams you look after*** - Direct reports, manager, suppliers etc.
- ***Standards of performance you are responsible for*** - Professional development, recruitment etc.
##### ***Resource*** - Things I will want to reference in the future
Information we want to keep as resources to support the rest of our projects or work.  These can be any topic you are interested in or anything you are actively researching

For example:
- ***What topics are you interested in?***  Beer brewing; Games theory; Retro gaming etc.
- ***What subjects are you researching?***  Habit formation; Notetaking; Nutrition etc.
- ***What useful information do you want to be able to reference?*** Management techniques;  Development theory;  Team building theory etc.
- ***What hobbies or passions do you have?***  Retro gaming; Movies etc.
##### ***Archive*** - Things I have completed or put on hold
This is a place to move any notes you no longer actively need.  For example:
- Projects you have completed or cancelled
- Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining
- Resources that are no longer relevant

Actively moving things into archive removes them from the notes that matter but keeps them in a place you can reference if things change and you need to get at the information again.
##### Where do I put this?
Questions to ask when deciding where a note should live
1. In which ***project*** will this be most useful?
2. If none: In which ***area*** will this be most useful?
3. If none: Which ***resource*** does this belong to?
4. If none: Place in ***archives***
#### ***Distil*** - Find the Essence
##### ***Highlighting 2.0*** - The Progressive Summarisation Technique
The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of *those* notes, and so on, distilling the essence of a note into several "layers".  Each of the layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.

Follow these steps to distil and find the essence of a piece:
- ***Extract*** - Take a sub-set of the source material that you are interested in that convey the main message.
- ***Bold the main points*** - Highlight the main points from the extracted piece by putting them in ***BOLD***.
- ***Highlight the most interesting part*** - This will be one or two sentences that encapsulate the essence of the note
- ***Executive Summary*** - Add a few bullet points at the top, in your own words, that summarises the note.
Here is an example
>[!quote] How the Brain Stops Time
>### Summary
> - Time dilation is the feeling that time is slowing down
> - It is often experienced during moments of intense fear
> - In an experiment, subjects experienced time moving 36% slower in a state of fear, compared to watching other's experience
> - Further experiments showed that time dilation allows us to remember our experiences better
> ---
> ### How the Brain Stops Time
> ***One of the strangest side effects of intense fear is <mark class="hltr-yellow">time dilation, the apparent slowing down of time</mark>*** ... survivors of life-and-death situations often report that things seem to take longer to happen, objects fall more slowly, and they're capable of complex thoughts in what would normally be the blink of an eye.
> Eagleman asked subjects who'd already taken the plunge to estimate how long it took them to fall, using a stopwatch to tick off what they felt to be an equivalent amount of time.  Then he asked them to watch someone else fall and then estimate the elapsed time for their plunge the same way.  ***On average, participants felt that*** <mark class="hltr-yellow">***their own experience had taken 36 percent longer***</mark>.  Time dilation was in effect.
> That means that fear does not actually speed up our rate of perception or mental processing.  ***Instead,*** <mark class="hltr-yellow">***it allows us to remember what we do experience in greater detail.***</mark>  Since our perception of time is based on the number of things we remember, fearful experiences thus seem to unfold more slowly.

##### Three Common Mistakes of Novice Notetakers
Here are some guidelines to help you avoid common pitfalls with highlighting your notes:
- ***Over-Highlighting*** - A helpful rule-of-thumb is that each layer should include no more than 10-20 percent of the previous layer.
- ***Highlighting without a purpose*** - Wait until you know how you'll put the note to use before highlighting.
- ***Make Highlighting difficult*** - Don't overthink it.  As long as it works for you, it is right.
#### ***Express*** - Show your work
##### Search
Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to. 
##### Browsing
If you have followed the [[#***Organise*** - Save for Actionability|PARA]] system to organise your notes, you already have a series of dedicated folders making locating the note you need, simple.
##### Tags
Add tags to your notes to group related notes together and make them easy to locate
##### Serendipity
Reviewing you notes can lead to unexpected connections
## Part Three
### The Shift - Making things happen
#### Strategies to bring creative work together
##### ***The Archipelago of Ideas*** - Give Yourself Stepping-Stones
Outline the ideas, sources or points that will form the backbone of your deliverable.  Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, link them together in an order that makes sense.
The goal is that instead of sitting down with a blank page or screen, you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts.  You then rearrange and sequence them into an order that flows logically.
##### ***The Hemingway Bridge*** - Use Yesterday's Momentum Today
Ernest Hemingway would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story.  Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear.  This meant the next time he sat down to work, he knew exactly where to start.  He build a "bridge" to the next day.

At the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to wrote down some of the following kinds of things in your notes:
- ***Ideas for the next steps*** - What could the next step be?
- ***Current Status*** - What is the current status and what is the most important open question?
- ***Details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten*** - Brain dump any important idea that could be forgotten if you stopped right now
- ***Your TODO list for the next session*** - Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next.
##### ***Dial Down the Scope*** - Ship Something Small and Concrete
Use agile iterative delivery.  Focus on the MVP[^MVP], then the MLP[^MLP] and build from there, using feedback from others to guide you to the final version.
#### Building Essential Habits
##### ***Project Checklists*** - Ensure you start and finish your projects in a consistent way, making use of past work
Project Kick-off
1. ***Capture*** my current thinking on the project
2. ***Review*** folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes
3. ***Search*** for related terms across all folders
4. ***Move*** (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder
5. ***Create*** an outline of collected notes and the planned project
	- ***Answer premortem questions*** - What do you want to learn?  What is the greatest source of uncertainty?  What is most likely to fail?
	- ***Communicate with stakeholders*** - Get agreement on the project scope
	- ***Define success criteria*** - What needs to happen for this to be successful?  What are the minimum results and are there any stretch goals?
	- ***Have an official Kick-off*** - Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and a timeline and write out any goals and objectives.
Project Completion
1. ***Mark*** project as complete
2. ***Cross out*** the project goal and move to "Completed"
3. ***Review*** any intermediate data and move them to other folders
4. ***Move*** project to archives across all platforms
5. ***If project is inactive*** add a current status note to the project before archiving
	- ***Answer any post-mortem questions*** - What did you learn?  What did you do well?  What could've gone better?  What can you improve next time?
	- ***Communicate with stakeholders*** - Confirm the outcome and that all are happy
	- ***Evaluate success criteria*** - Were the objectives all met?
	- ***Officially close the project and celebrate*** - Always remember to celebrate when closing a project
##### ***Weekly and Monthly Reviews*** - Periodically review your work and life to decide if you want to change anything
Weekly Review
1. ***Clear my inbox*** - Make sure all emails are responded to and filed appropriately
2. ***Check my calendar*** - Landscape for the week ahead.  Is there anything I need to follow-up on?  Is there anything I need to prepare for?
4. ***Clear my notes inbox*** - Move any new notes into the correct place in my filing system
5. ***Choose my tasks for the next week*** - What do I want to achieve in the next week.  Build an initial TODO list so I can start the next week positively
Monthly Review
1. ***Review and update my goals*** - Review my goals for the month.  What successes or accomplishments did I have?  What can I learn from?
2. ***Review and update my project list*** - Are all the current projects at the correct status?  Are there any new projects I need to add?
3. ***Review my areas of responsibility*** - Review the major areas of my life to see if there is anything I need more focus on
4. ***Review someday/maybe tasks*** - Review my [[Visualising your Goals#Moonshots|Moonshots]]
5. ***Re-prioritise tasks*** - Finally, once I have an idea of what the week will bring, re-prioritise what I need to work on.
