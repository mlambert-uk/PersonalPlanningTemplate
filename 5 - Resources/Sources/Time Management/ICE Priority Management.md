**ICE** is an acronym for **I**mpact, **C**onfidence and **E**ase.
These three metrics offer great discussion points and helps create alignment.
### Impact
“How much does this feature/change contribute to the overall goal?”

1 = No impact
3 = Very low impact
4 = Low impact
6 = Medium impact
8 = High impact
10 = Very high impact
### Confidence
“How confident are you that this new feature/change will actually work?”

1 = No confidence
3 = Very low confidence
4 = Low confidence
6 = Medium confidence
8 = High confidence
10 = Very high confidence
### Ease
“How hard is this to implement?”

NB: This is not restricted to the technical development, but consideration also needs to be given to any operational change, or pre-dev work required.
1 = Extremely hard
3 = Hard
5 = Medium
7 = Easy
10 = Very Easy
### Calculating the Score
The final ICE score is calculated by multiplying the 3 values. You will end up with a score between 1 and 1000.
The higher the score, the higher the priority.
### Example
| Priorities           | Impact | Confidence | Ease | Score |
