In other words, the amount of time you give yourself to complete a specific task is the amount of time it will take you to complete that task.
## How it works
This is not a time management technique _per se_. It’s a law that, when understood, can be applied as one of the most beneficial time management methods out there—but you will have to put in the work. That means working more efficiently in shorter bursts of time. Here are some time management tips:
### Try working without a computer charger 
This will force you to finish a project before your computer dies. But please, make sure you save your work regularly :LiLaugh:
### Get it done early
Instead of finishing an essay by midnight, try to get it done by noon. Set an earlier deadline for yourself with some buffer contingency time, just in case things take longer than expected.
### Set a deadline 
Similar to the above idea, give yourself a set time to do something—and then cut it in half.  This ensures you have a buffer.
### Limit time for tasks 
Sometimes called Timeboxing.  Give yourself a set amount of time to complete a task.  For example,  20 minutes in the morning to answer emails.
