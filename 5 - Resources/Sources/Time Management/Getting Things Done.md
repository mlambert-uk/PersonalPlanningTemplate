# Getting Things Done (GTD) Method
This process helps you get things done by recording tasks on paper and then breaking them down into actionable work items.
## How it works
1. **Capture the actions that have your attention**: These actions are tasks that can relate to anything from work to your personal life. 
2. **Clarify what they mean**: Decide whether the tasks that have your attention are actionable or not. If an item is not actionable, ignore it for now. If the item is actionable, do it, delegate it, or set it aside (Use the [[Eisenhower Matrix]] to help you decide. 
3. **Organize your actions**: Prioritize your to do list according to what you need to get done when.
4. **Reflect**: Review your list of actions frequently to determine your next priority. Cross off tasks you have accomplished and update your list.
5. **Engage**: Take the actions or smaller tasks you can complete right now.
