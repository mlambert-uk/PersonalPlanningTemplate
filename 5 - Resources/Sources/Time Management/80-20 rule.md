# Pareto Analysis
The 80/20 rule is a technique created by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It’s the idea that 20% of actions are responsible for 80% of outcomes. The goal of Pareto analysis is to help you prioritize tasks that are most effective at solving problems.

**How it works:**

1. **List some of the problems you are facing.** For example, maybe your grades are slipping.
2. **Identify the root cause** **of each problem. Maybe your grades are slipping because you spend too much time on social media or any other sort of distraction.**
3. **Assign a score to each problem**: Assign higher numbers to more important problems 
4. **Group problems together by cause**: Group together all the problems caused by spending too much time on social media. 
5. **Add up the score of each group**: The group with the highest score is the issue you should work on first. 
6. **Take action**.
