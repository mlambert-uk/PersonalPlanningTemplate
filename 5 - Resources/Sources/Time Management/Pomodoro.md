The Pomodoro Technique was created by entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo. This technique uses a timer to break down your work into intervals. Each interval is known as a _Pomodoro,_ named after the tomato-shaped timer that Cirillo created. 
## How it works
1. Choose a single task to focus on. 
2. Set a timer for 25 mins and work only on the selected task
3. After 25 mins work, take a five minute break.  Go for a walk, grab a cup of coffee, do something non-work-related to give your brain a break.
4. Repeat steps one to three four times.
5. Take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes.

This technique can be really great when working from home with other people in the house.  Stepping away on a break and having a 5 minute chat is a positive way to stay engaged with work, and make time for those around you, as well as increasing your productivity and focus.
