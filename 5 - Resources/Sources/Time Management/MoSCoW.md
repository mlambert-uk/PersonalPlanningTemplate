This is a well-known and oft-used prioritisation model that helps to drive what should be done in a priority order.
The initial MoSCoW prioritisation is done on receipt of the requirements, to make sure the focus is on the minimum viable product, where relevant.
From this point, stories/tickets will have the associated DevOps priority assigned to them.
## Mo
### Must Have
These are the absolute minimum requirements and must be delivered as part of any MVP, or launch/day one.
## S
### Should Have
These are not 100% necessary for launch/day one and will not have an undue negative impact on experience/usability.

They should be delivered soon after launch.
## Co
### Could Have
These are “nice to have” and are definitely not required for launch.

These might include cosmetic changes, or other features that don’t have a material impact.
## W
### Won't Have
These requirements are not considered necessary for the value of the project to be delivered and will be ruled out of any future development phase.
