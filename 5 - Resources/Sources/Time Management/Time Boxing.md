Time Boxing is setting a fixed timeframe to complete a task.  It can be a great way to get to a conclusion about something you are not 100% certain about and allow you to break things down into more manageable chunks.
## How it works
Time boxing asks you to limit how much time you'll dedicate to completing a task.  Here's a time boxed version of the time blocking example above: "I will finish a first draft of my blog post tomorrow between 9am and 11am."

This self-imposed "time box" forces you to work efficiently because you have a limited amount of time in which to complete the task. It can be a fun way to challenge yourself and gamify your productivity.

This technique can be really effective when doing research of different possible options before selecting a way forwards.  By timeboxing investigations into different methods, it ensures you have the time to explore all options without going too far down any one track.  Timebox the initial investigation of each possible solution, and then once all options have been explored, decide on which one will work best.
