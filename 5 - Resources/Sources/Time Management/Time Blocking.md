Time blocking is a time management method that asks you to divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated to accomplishing a specific task or group of tasks, and only those specific tasks. Instead of keeping an open-ended to-do list of things you’ll get to as you can, you’ll start each day with a concrete schedule outlining what you’ll work on and when.  This can be especially useful where context switching is a big problem.

The key to this method is prioritizing your task list in advance — a dedicated weekly review is a must. Take stock of what’s coming up for the week ahead, and make a rough sketch of your time blocks for each day. At the end of every workday, review any tasks you didn’t finish — as well as any new tasks that have come in — and adjust your time blocks for the rest of the week accordingly.

With days that are time blocked in advance, you won’t have to constantly make choices about what to focus on. All you need to do is follow your time blocked schedule. If you get off-task or distracted, simply look at your schedule and get back to whichever task you blocked off time for.
## How it works
1. Write down all the tasks you need to perform today and sort them by priority
2. Work through each task in turn
	1. If the task will take <5 minutes, do it now!
	2. If the task will take >5 minutes, book a slot in your calendar to complete the task.
3. Once your calendar is full, any remaining tasks will go on tomorrows todo list

By setting dedicated time aside to complete tasks, it ensures you have the time to properly focus your attention on the task.
By using your calendar to manage your tasks, it ensures you take into account any meetings or other events you will need to complete.
If an event or task finishes early, use the spare time to take a break, or review any new emails, before you pick up the next task.  If new priorities come in throughout the day, look at what  tasks will need to be moved and decide if the new task is of high enough priority.

## Task Batching
Task batching is when you group similar (usually smaller) tasks together and schedule specific time blocks to complete all at once. By tackling similar tasks in a group, you’ll limit the amount of context switching you have to do throughout your day, saving precious time and mental energy. For example, scheduling two 20-minute blocks to process email during the day is more efficient than checking your inbox every 15 minutes.
