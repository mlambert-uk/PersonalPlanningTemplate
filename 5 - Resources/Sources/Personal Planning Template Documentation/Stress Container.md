# Stress container
We all feel stress in our lives.  Stresses can come from all areas of our lives, some of them small, some of them larger.  We can all handle different amounts of stress.  Think about your capacity to handle stress like a container.  The container fills up with stress over time.  If you do not find ways to reduce the stress or release the tap on the container, it risks overflowing.  When your container fills up to the brim, that's when more serious mental health issues can occur, such as anxiety and depression, which can be even more stressful to overcome.

It is important that you are aware of how full your container is, and where the stresses come from.  Think about all the areas of [[MyWholeSelf]].  Is there anything we can do to reduce or remove completely any of the stresses you are under?  If so, consider adding a goal to your [[My Goals Board.canvas|My Goals Board]].
## Coping methods for stress
Helpful coping methods can act as a tap to let stress out of the container and stop it from overflowing.  On the other hand, unhelpful coping methods can block the tap, preventing it from reducing.
### Blocking the tap
Unhelpful coping methods, such as overworking or relying too much on caffeine or alcohol, can block the tap and prevent stress from flowing out of your container.  If we use these strategies too often then our container will fill up and be at risk of overflowing.

### Releasing the tap
Helpful coping methods such as exercise, hobbies or talking to a friend, can open the tap of your container.  Making time for these helpful activities lets stress flow out of the container – so even when there are more stresses than usual going in, it doesn’t overflow.
