# Happiness Heart

Filling your life with happiness is an important aspect that can often get overlooked or forgotten about in the chaos of daily life.

### Dedicate time to do something that makes you happy every day
Make a commitment to yourself to lead a happy life.  Make a start by doing something that makes you happy every single day.  It can be something as simple as stepping outside for 5 minutes and just being in nature, or treating yourself to a long soak in the bath.  Whatever you chose, ensure it adds a little bit of happiness into your day.
### Do something kind for others
Doing something kind for someone else, without and requirement for praise or acknowledgement, can be a great way to increase your own personal happiness.  Putting a little bit on kindness into the world can have a huge unseen knock on effect.
### Plan something to look forward to
Ensure you always have something to look forward to.  It can be a small thing, like planning a nice soak in the tub, or watching a program or film with the family, through to larger events, like a summer holiday or an anniversary celebration.  Having things to look forward too can have a large impact on how happy you feel
### Be in the moment
It is important that you savour the moment.  Take a moment to step outside and feel the wind on your face.  Experience nature.  Or just put your phone down and do something, like a crossword or puzzle.  In a world full of information overload, stepping out of it, even for a moment, can have a really significant impact on your mental wellbeing.  
### Nurture positive relationships
Make time for people who make you feel good.  Spending time talking with friends and loved ones can help to release your [[Stress Container]] valve, improving your mental wellbeing.
