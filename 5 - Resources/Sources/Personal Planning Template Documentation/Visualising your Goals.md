# What is a goals board?
A goals board is a visual representation of your goals.  They are useful because:

- They give you a visual reminder if what you have set yourself to accomplish
- It means you don't need to remember what goals you have set; they are on the board!
- It ensures you are moving forwards and focusing your time on the right things
- It ensures you do not overlook any part of your [[My Whole Self]]
