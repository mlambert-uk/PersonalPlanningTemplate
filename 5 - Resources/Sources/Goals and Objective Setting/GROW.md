## Goal
This is the goal we want to achieve.  The goal has to be defined in such a way that it is very clear when it has been achieved.  A good model to use is [[SMART]]
## Reality
The current reality of where the individual is now.  What are the issues, the challenges, how far are they away from their goal?
## Obstacles / Options
There will be Obstacles stopping the individual from getting from where they are now to where they want to go.  If there were no obstacles, the individual would've already reached their goal.
Once the Obstacles have been identified, what are the options available to overcome them?
## Way forward
The options identified should be converted into action steps, detailing the way forward.  The way forward should also include how dedicated the individual is on achieving the goal.  How will they energise and motivate themselves to complete all the actions?  Is there sufficient desire to make it happen?
