SMART is a technique for ensuring objectives are framed in such a way as to make them achievable.  It can be easy to set quite generic objectives, like 'Improve my fitness' without understanding how that is achievable or measurable by the individual.  SMART ensures you consider all sides of an objective before setting and agreeing to it.
## Specific
Any objective needs to be easily understood.  Generalisations can be misinterpreted, or there are no active steps an individual can take to realistically improve them.  Objectives should clearly state what will be done and who will do it so anyone reading it can understand.
## Measurable
Any objective needs to be measurable in some way; otherwise how can you verify it has been completed successfully?  For any objective, you need a way to measure the current state and measure the future state to show progress.  It helps the individual to stay on track and on schedule.
## Achievable
Any objective needs to be something that the individual is able to achieve on their own, with no dependencies on others.  If there are dependencies, then if those dependencies do not materialise, it can be impossible to achieve the objective.  Ensuring the objective is completely within the individuals power to complete is essential in ensuring it is relevant and achievable.  It should be reasonable for them to achieve given everything else they are doing at the time.
## Relevant / Realistic
A relevant objective helps to move the individual forward in their growth.  It should be in-line with the culture, structure and vision of whatever they are doing and where they are.  It should be within reach.
## Timely / Time-bound
Objectives need a timeframe to be set to make them more purposeful.  
### Example of bad objectives
#### Improve my fitness
This objective is not specific, what are we doing to improve our fitness?  How can we make improvements?
It is not measurable.  What is our current fitness level?  How can we prove we have improved it?
It is not achievable.  We do not know what we need to do to be successful.
It is not realistic.  Because we do not know what we need to do, or how we can measure it, it is not realistic to expect us to be successful in completing the objective.
We have not set a timeframe, so we have no way of knowing when the objective is completed.
### Example of how SMART can improve objectives
#### Improve my overall fitness levels by increasing my daily step count from 3,000 to at least 10,000 steps per day (on average) over the next 3 months
This objective is specific, we are increasing the daily step count.  It is measurable, from 3,000 to 10,000.  It is achievable - 10,000 steps is a realistic number, often used as the recommended number of steps by health apps.  It is realistic, we are not expecting them to be able to run a marathon, just increase how much walking they are doing.  And finally it is timely, we have set a timeframe of 3 months.
