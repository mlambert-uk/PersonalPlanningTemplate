Prep time: 
Cooking time: 
## Ingredients
- 1 & 3/4 cup/250g Plain Flour
- 1/2 cup/100g Unrefined Caster Sugar, plus extra for coating.
- 2/3 cup/75g  Mixed Currants
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 3 tsp Mixed Spice (ground cinnamon, nutmeg, clove)
- A pinch salt
- 1/2 cup/125g Non Dairy Butter
- 1/4 cup/60ml Non Dairy milk

## Method
1. Add all the dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the vegan butter and rub into the flour mixture with your hands to form a breadcrumb like consistency. 
2. Pour in enough milk to bind the mix into a dough. 
3. Tip the mix out on to a floured surface and roll to the thickness of your little finger.
4. Using a cutter, cut the dough into disks around 2 inches in diameter. 
5. Preheat it a heavy bottom skillet over a low heat. Rub a tiny bit of coconut oil into the pan then cook the cakes in small quantities until golden on each side.
6. Once cooked, sprinkle over the additional caster sugar while the cakes are still hot.
7. To make the whipped cream, scoop the creamy part from the tin of coconut milk. Add it to a bowl with the sugar and vanilla essence. Whisk the mix until thick.

Serve the Welsh Cakes with a dollop of cream & fresh strawberries.
